This is the GitHub Repo that contains everything needed for the NUCE 403 and 430 project. Codename Hades Rain.


# Reactor Specifics Discussion

Fuel Enrichment less than 19.75 wt%

Power 15-25 MWth

Lifetime 4-10 yr

External Diameter less than 3m

Height less than 5m

## Fuel Type: High Enriched Pu-239 (19.75 wt %)

We chose plutonium as our fuel choice 

## Coolant Type:Heavy Water with Graphite-doped Stainless Steel clad

Heavy water became our standout coolant type mostly due to it's exceptionally low absorption cross sections. We want the least amount of parasitic absorptions so that we can have as low enriched a fuel as possible, making for the most economically sustainable fuel cycle as possible.

Stainless steel was chose as the cladding type for multiple reasons. One being it's ductility, able to aptly respond to the demanding conditions imposed by 25 MWt coming out of such a small system, and another being it's innate carbon content, which we can further dope with excess carbon to increase moderating

## Reflector: Graphite

We are making graphite-plated reflector panels 

## Controls: Low Enriched Fuel-Tipped Rods, Borated Graphite

With fuel tipped-rods, their insertion adds a drastic amount of negative reactivity, allowing for very quick shutdowns should we be approaching a criticality accident.
